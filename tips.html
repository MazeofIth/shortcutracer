    <h1>ShortcutRacer — Tips and Tricks</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <p>A tip is to use <a target="_blank"
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">Vimium</a>.
        <br><br>
        An excellent article (I haven't written it): <a target="_blank" href="https://t.co/Fipkcjgwlx">How To Become A
            True Keyboard Warrior (And Stop Using Your Mouse)</a> <br><br>You can use the shortcut alt+r to replay the
        level ;)<br>
        <hr><br>

        The theory behind the site is that we have e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https:/typeracer.com">TypeRacer</a>,
        which is an addictive way to improve one's typing skillz, but nothing similar for shortcuts (aka using the
        computer in the most effective way possible). <br><br> It's quite frustrating to read up on 100 different
        shortcuts and then painstakingly try to memorize and use them in your everyday compute-life.</be></b><br><br>
        <hr><br>
        The game is broken regardless, so "cheating" is encouraged (The point is to use the computer in the fastest way
        possible, one of which is "hacks" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)"
